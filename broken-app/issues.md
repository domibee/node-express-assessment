# Broken App Issues

1. **Using `var`**: Instead of `var`, it's better to use `const` or `let` for declaring variables. In modern JavaScript, `const` and `let` provide block-level scope, which helps prevent certain types of bugs.

2. **Error Handling**: The catch block in the `try-catch` statement should have a parameter (`err` in this case) to catch any errors. Without this, it might not behave as expected.

3. **Async/Await**: The `map` function is used with `async` functions, which returns an array of Promises. You need to use `Promise.all` to await all the Promises in the array.

4. **Missing Middleware**: There's no middleware handling the request body. You might want to use `express.json()` or similar middleware to parse the request body.

5. **`req.body` is undefined**: It seems like the code is expecting `req.body` to contain a property named `developers`, but it's not clear whether the necessary middleware for parsing JSON is set up.

6. **Sending JSON response**: Instead of `JSON.stringify`, you can use `res.json()` to send a JSON response. This simplifies the process and sets the appropriate content type header.

7. **No Error Handling Middleware**: There's no error-handling middleware set up in the app. This means that unhandled errors might not provide a meaningful response to the client.

8. **Async/Await with Map**: Using `map` with `async` functions will return an array of Promises. You need to use `Promise.all` to handle them properly.

9. **Comments**: It's good practice to provide comments explaining the purpose of your code. For instance, what each route or function is intended to do.

10. **Catching Errors Properly**: It's a good practice to handle errors with proper status codes and error messages. Returning `next(err)` without setting the status code won't provide much information to the client.
